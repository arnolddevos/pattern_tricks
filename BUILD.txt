This project is actually a small landslide presentation.  To build the presentation:

- obtain landslide: https://github.com/adamzap/landslide

- bash landslide.sh

- open presentation.html in a browser 

(but if you have IE6 please surrender it at your nearest police station)

The .scala files go with the presentation and illustrate the ideas.
